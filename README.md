# sql-to-json
If you're like me, you probably have to mockup a sql table into a json file: create a console application to fetch data and serialize into json..
Well, this time I've created a basic, easy and quick solution to do this with a simple Windows GUI..

## Could it be better?
Absolutely. Feel free to make changes, create your own, or whatever!
